# Roomaries

As my final project for Harvard's CS50x course, I independently created Roomaries Grocery, a web-based application that allows roommates to more easily manage their shared grocery list and the cost of those groceries. The application is interactive and was built using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
